# CrownCooler
"Crown" shaped cooling duct and associated hot end mount for Voron Trident and V2.4 printers

This mod originally was developed to
- mount a Rapido HF/UHF hot end
- improve overall cooling performance by increasing airflow using a CPAP tube
- provide uniform cooling with airflow directed downwards
- be lightweight and easy to maintain
- be compatible with standard voron carriage and extruder mounting parts
- work with klickyprobe

# Installation instructions 
- This mod uses the standard stealthburner X carriage parts. The back piece of the rapido toolhead mount is also used.
- This mod should work with all types of extruder mounting parts, including CW2 (however, I have not yet tested it). I use the orbiter V2 extruder mount found [here](https://github.com/sneakytreesnake/StealthOrbiter).
- Print the cooling duct with no supports (if your printer can handle the overhang at the top) or build plate only supports, file in STL folder. Recommended to use 0.1mm layer height.
- Print the front toolhead part with supports. The rear toolhead part is the standard rapido voron part.
- Print the offset klickyprobe mount, file in STL folder.

# CrownCooler
"Crown" shaped cooling duct and associated hot end mount for Voron Trident and V2.4 printers

This mod was developed to:
- mount a Rapido HF/UHF hot end & Dragon SF/HF/UHF hot end
- improve overall cooling performance by increasing airflow using a CPAP tube
- provide uniform cooling with airflow directed downwards
- be lightweight and easy to maintain
- be compatible with standard voron carriage and extruder mounting parts
- work with klickyprobe & euclid probe

**This mod is still a BETA. Expect issues.**

# Installation instructions 
- This mod uses the standard stealthburner X carriage parts. The back piece of the rapido toolhead mount is also used.
- This mod should work with all types of extruder mounting parts, including CW2 (however, I have not yet tested it). I use the orbiter V2 extruder mount found [here](https://github.com/sneakytreesnake/StealthOrbiter).
- Print the cooling duct with no supports, file in STL folder. Recommended to use 0.1mm layer height.
- Print the front & rear toolhead part with supports. 
- Only euclid and klicky probes are compatible at the moment. Use the offset klicky mount for HF hot ends, use the tall offset clock mount for UHF hot ends.


# Development Roadmap
1)[COMPLETE] - Proof of concept testing

2)[IN PROGRESS] - Beta testers needed!

3)Final release!
